## 🛠️ Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3

## 💡 Features

- Semantic HTML structure
- Centered QR container using CSS margin (initially)
- Responsive image handling
- Clean, minimalist design

## 📌 Lessons Learned

- Learned how inline elements like `<img>` behave and why `display: block` is necessary for margin auto centering.
- Practiced alternative centering methods (margin vs. flexbox).
- Improved understanding of layout fundamentals and responsive structure.

### ✅ What I’m Proud Of:
I was proud of how I used `margin` to center the QR container instead of relying on Flexbox.

### 🔧 What I’d Do Differently:
Next time, I’d use Flexbox to center the QR container—it’s cleaner and more flexible.

### 🧱 Challenges I Faced:
I had trouble centering the image inside the QR container. I realized that the image is an inline element by default, so I set its `display` to `block` and used `margin: 0 auto` to center it.

### 📘 What I Still Need Help With:
- Centering the QR image within the container using Flexbox
- Making the design responsive for mobile devices
- Adjusting text alignment and spacing inside the QR container
